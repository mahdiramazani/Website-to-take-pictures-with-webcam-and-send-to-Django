# Website-to-take-pictures-with-webcam-and-send-to-Django


In this project, the user comes and takes a photo of himself on the web page, and the photo is saved in the canvas tag, and the content of the canvas tag is converted to base64, and this content is stored in the form whose input type is hidden, and the form is sent to Django and to view, we will convert the photo that we converted to base64 format to jpeg format and save it in the desired path and save it in our database.
